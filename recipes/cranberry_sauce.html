        <h3 class="subhead">Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>Believe it or not, this homemade cranberry sauce comes together quickly and easily with just three easy-to-find ingredients. Here's what you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fresh Cranberries:</strong> Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Cranberries:</strong>> White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Orange Juice:</strong> All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
        </ul>
